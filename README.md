# Dbarone.Net.Fake
A .NET Fake Dataset Generator.

This library contains a number of classes to faciliate the creation of fake data. This project will be used in some of my other data related projects where large amount of synthetic data is required for testing and demonstration purposes.

## Library Reference
For a full API reference of this library, please refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/davidbarone/Dbarone.Net.Fake/blob/main/Documentation.md).
